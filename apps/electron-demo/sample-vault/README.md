# Sample Vault for Wiki-Link Verification

This is a **demo vault** for exercising the Obsidian-style `[[wiki link]]` feature
added in the `add-wikilinks` change proposal.

## How to use

1. `cd apps/electron-demo && pnpm dev` (or `pnpm build && pnpm start`).
2. Click the **Vault** toolbar button and pick this folder
   (`apps/electron-demo/sample-vault/`).
3. Open any note and confirm the behaviors below.

## What to verify

- **Plain link** — see [[index]]
- **Alias link** — see [[index|start here]]
- **Hub & spoke** — open [[index]], check the 🔗 backlinks panel: every note
  in this vault links back to `index.md`.
- **Globally unique basename** — from [[Daily/2026-04-20]], the link `[[AI]]`
  resolves to `Topics/AI.md` even though it lives in a different folder.
- **Same-directory collision** — `work/Inbox.md` and `personal/Diary.md` both
  reference `[[Meeting]]`. Each resolves to the **neighbor** in its own
  directory, not the one in the other folder.
- **Unresolved (ghost) link** — [[Ghost Note]] in `ghost-demo.md` should render
  dashed + muted. Clicking it creates `Ghost Note.md` next to the active file.
- **Escape sequence** — `\[[NotALink]]` in `ghost-demo.md` stays literal.
- **Autocomplete** — in a new note, type `[[me` and confirm the popup lists
  `Meeting` (twice, one per directory) plus other matches.
